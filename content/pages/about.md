Hi! My name is JoÃ£o Rebelo and I am an Information Systems Engineer. Or Manager. Or both. My degree says both. I like both.

I often describe myself as a "jack of all trades" as I have worked in a diverse amount of subdomains in both technology and business. However, as per my experience, my current specialization is in Big Data and modern Web Development. Having grown up around businesses and due to my background in IS, I am particularly skilled to work in the gap between business and technology. Given the current challenges we are facing that relate to information and technology, I am also heavily interested in facts, truth in information and the value in data.

### Skills & Interests

In personal and academic projects I have worked with a wide variety of current technologies and tools such as JavaScript (React, Gatsby), NodeJS, Python, Java, SQL, MongoDB, Hadoop and Tableau, GraphQL and REST APIs, Docker and others.

I have various areas of interest, including Data Engineering, Big Data, BI, Smart Cities and IoT, Web Development, Data Analytics and Visualization, having worked with novel concepts such as Mixed Reality and Immersive Analytics. 

I am also heavily interested in the business aspect of technology, product development and design. I have acquired strong communication and leadership capabilities from managing several projects and teams, and from delivering presentations to varied audiences and stakeholders.

#### About this page

This page was created because I wanted to do some Gatsby and React thinkering after watching [Jason Langstorf's](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) great Gatsby courses on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/jason-lengstorf/) and a few of his videos on [LearnWithJason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/). 

This is a static site / PWA / personal blog / portfolio page / highly performant Gatsby app based on the [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/) by [Alex Shelepenok](https://github.com/alxshelepenok). Deployed on Netlify with their great CD wizardry alonside GitHub.
