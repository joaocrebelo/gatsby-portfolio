Hi! My name is JoÃ£o Rebelo and I am an Information Systems (IS) Engineer. Or Manager. Or both. My degree says both. I like both.

I often describe myself as a "jack of all trades" as I enjoy exploring most of the landscape from business to information technology and everything in between. Having grown up around businesses and given the business-minded background of part of the IS curriculum, I am particularly skilled to work in the gap between business and technology. Tech-wise, and given my experience, my areas of preference are Big Data (namely Immersive Analytics) and modern Web Development (including novel experiments with Mixed Reality), although I've been fortunate enough to work in both personal and academic projects in areas such as Smart Cities, IoT, data visualization, networking, . Given the current challenges we are facing that relate to information and technology, I am also heavily interested in facts, truth in information and the value of data and its interpretation - [Factfullness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness) should be mandatory reading in every school.

I have had the chance to work with tools and technologies such as JavaScript (Vanilla, React, Gatsby), NodeJS, Python, Java; SQL, MongoDB, the Hadoop ecossystem and Tableau, GraphQL and REST APIs, Docker and Netlify. I am also heavily interested in the business aspect of technology, product development and design. Having had the chance to be team leader in several group projects I was able to develop good foundational leadership capabilities. I have also strenghtened my communication skills by delivering presentations to varied audiences and stakeholders.

#### About this page

This page was created because I wanted to do some Gatsby and React thinkering after watching [Jason Langstorf's](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) great Gatsby courses on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/jason-lengstorf/) and a few of his videos on [LearnWithJason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/). 

This is a static site / PWA / personal blog / portfolio page / highly performant Gatsby app based on the [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/) by [Alex Shelepenok](https://github.com/alxshelepenok). Deployed on Netlify with their great CD wizardry alonside GitHub.
