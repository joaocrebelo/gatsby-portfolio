Through my work in Research & Development at [LabSecIoT](https://labseciot.dsi.uminho.pt) and [LynxLab](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/maribel/lynxlab/index.html) I've participated and presented at various conferences, having published the following scientific content:

## An Immersive Visualization System for a Big Data Context in Bosch’s Industry 4.0 Movement

#### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify;">Motivated by challenges that emerged from Complex Event Processing (CEP) in Big Data contexts, an Intelligent Event Broker (IEB) was previously proposed as a CEP system built on flexible and scalable Big Data technologies and techniques, being already applied to Industry 4.0 scenarios. A key feature of the IEB lies in an effective visualization system for metamonitorization and management. An analysis of previous scientific and technical literature has shown scarcity of proposals or development of such mechanisms. This paper proposes a Web Visualization Platform for managing and monitoring an IEB system based on novel approaches that include interactive exploration techniques, tridimensional visualizations and mixed-reality environments. Being mainly targeted towards Industry 4.0, this paper presents a demonstration case at Bosch Car Multimedia Portugal. Results indicate that significant value can be obtained when the visualization system is applied to decision support scenarios within organizations foreseeing event processing, Big Data, and Industry 4.0 projects.</div>

#### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify;">Current trends in technology development, both in terms of processing and communications, brought a new paradigm known as IoT (Internet of Things). Notwithstanding all anticipated advantages, from business to quality of life impacts, there are important challenges to overcome. Above all security and privacy requirements need to be addressed carefully looking for ways to control trust levels. Concerning system architecture, another problem arises from the limited bandwidth available at the Cloud level (where processing today occurs for the type of applications in question), to connect directly to million of devices sending very little amount of information, but continuously. This problem has been addressed through the concept of Edge or Fog Computing. This project aims to design such an edge, with specific requirements to support Smart Cities or similar environments, such as: accept and deal with different devices’ security levels; dynamically process the information and provide it through an API; keep historical data to provide a proper big data/machine learning information source; offer a platform to securely manage the deployed devices; and design a dynamic and intuitive dashboard displaying the information, warnings and alert messages, in formats suitable to all stakeholders.
